# Notes App (Part 2)

This project is a simple notes application built with React and Vite as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course by the University of Helsinki.

## Overview

The Notes app allows users to add, view, and mark notes as important. It demonstrates the use of React state, effects, and communication with a backend server (JSON Server).

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

3. **Start the JSON server for backend (in a separate terminal):**

    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```

    This will start a mock backend at [http://localhost:3001/notes](http://localhost:3001/notes).

## Additional Notes

- Node.js version: 18.x or newer is recommended.
- The backend uses [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for local development.
- For later parts, you may need to connect to a real backend as described in the course material.
